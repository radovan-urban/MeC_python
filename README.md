## MeC_python
Data acquisition and analysis suite

### Purpose
Data acquisition and computer control of complex experimental systems is essential for both academic and indistrial research.  Such software is rarely available for a cutting-edge experimental systems.  It is up us, experimentalists, to hack just enough to get data and results we need. 

Python3 was chosen 

### Design framework
We are designing a modular system that allows to use an individual module for each "instrument" either controlling a part of the experimantal setup or collects data.  This design offers a great flexibility in adding/removing modeules as needed.  Moreover, it allows an easy porting of the software to a different exmerimental aparatus with different instruments.
